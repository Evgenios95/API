# API
API using Node.js and Express.js (No DB, but JSON files to store my data. Will use Firebase or MongoDB after my exams)

**Commands to run** (since I have my node_modules in gitignore):
- npm init
- npm install express --save
- npm install -g nodemon (globally)
- npm install --save-dev nodemon (as a dev dependency)
- You can also add a script "start": "nodemon server.js" in package.json if it doesn't exist.

**Documentation:**

**TODO**:

Too much duplication and shitty code due to lack of time (exam preparation). 
Will be refactored in the summer + addition of a DB. We weren't allowed to use a DB for this project, but JSON files.
